/**
 * @file beeper.h 
 *
 * @brief API for generating tones using timer(s).
 *
 * This file provides a basic API to use the Atmega328p timers as tone generators.
 *
 * In order to use this API an interrupt implementation must be enabled in config.h for a requested timer (TDELAY_IMPLEMENT_T0_INT, TDELAY_IMPLEMENT_T1_INT, TDELAY_IMPLEMENT_T2_INT).
 * For details please refer to the documentation of config.h options
 *
 * This API works in general the same as tdelay API. The only difference between those two is that beeper API in addition toggles the OCXA pin of the associated timer in order to
 * generate the requested frequency on the pin. For all timers only TIMERX_COMPA_vect interrupt is implemented and only OCXA output is used. This implementation does not support and/or
 * handle the OCXB output and OCXB outputs.
 *
 * @example beeper_01.c
 *
 * General beeper API usage example
 *
 * @example beeper_02.c
 *
 * Using beeper_block() and beeper_off() functions
