/**
 * @file dev_d7seg.h 
 *
 * @brief Simple implementation of the 7 segment display multiplexing technique
 *
 * This module provides an easy way to handle your 7 segment displays. It provides a general API and a basic font
 * for 7 segment display.
 *
 * This module defines practically 4 routines only to handle the display. The init routine initialize the display context
 * to a known state, the d7seg_chr_p and d7seg_chr_dot_p macros are used to place a digit into a given display - you can either
 * use a bare number (0-9) as an argument or any value defined in d7s_chars enumeration in order to use the standard built-in font.
 * You don't have to worry again about segment mapping to your font etc - the API takes care about everything for you.
 * The multiplexing routine switches the data on the display data lines and switches the selection line to the next one in order to activate 
 * another display segment - you can use it anywhere - in you standard execution loop as well as in interrupts - it doesn't matter.
 *
 * Since we are relying on static memory allocation you must define the maximum number of segments your display may have (D7SEG_MAX_DISPLAYS) in config.h
 * By default - in order to save memory this macro is configured to 4. Most common displays have only four segments.
 * This driver can support many displays at a time as well. Just define as many context as you want (can), and use the accordingly with the procedures provided.
 *
 * @example d7seg.c
 *
 * Using 7seg display API
