# libpca - Pure C Arduino Library - a set of API's for Atmega328p MCU.

Simple C static library to ease up development process for Arduino in pure C, without Arduino C++ Library.

## Currently it implements

* Timer Delays (Arduino Library sleep/millis equivalent)
* Beeper - Tone generation (Arduino Library tone equiv.)
* Serial port support - Interrupt driven data reception, data reception by polling, data transmission by polling
* SLIP protocol - serial line data synchronization protocol, to support binary data transfers over serial line

## Features at the development stage

* Timer PWM support
* ADC API - to be implemented
