 * @brief Private common API for timer delays & beeper. 
 *
 * This file provides a common API for timer based delays and beeper API. Some common parts of those two very similar implementations has been extracted in order
 *  to avoid code duplication. This file is based on the timer_common.h API which provides some convenient API over timers which obviously is common as well for both
 *  beeper/tdelay API.
 * 
 * This file is mainly a private library interface and shouldn't really be used in the code outside the library

/**
 * @brief Since we do not have to use all timers for delays, there is
 *  no need to implement and declare interrupts and data structures for
 * 	every timer. That's why there is a need for tdelay specific denomination.
 *	
 * Once can imagine a situation in which only implementation of interrupt for timer 1 has been enabled.
 * This means that the subscript in the actual array holding the data for timer delays, for timer 1 will be equal to 0, which stands in
 * contradiction to E_TIMER1 definition. That is why this special denomination has been introduce.
